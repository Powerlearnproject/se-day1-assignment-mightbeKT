Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
It enables creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Developmet of programming language
The rise of agile methodologies
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements
Design
Implementation
Testing
Deployment
Maintenance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology involves following a step by step format to develop software (eg Design then Implementation then Testing etc) while Agile methodology involves flexible development in which the client is consulted after every sprint(2 - 3 weeks) for any changes needed

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - writes codes to implement softtware solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager - oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for debugging, witing and testing code. Examples: Visual Studios, Eclipse
VCS track changes to source code and coordinate work among team members. Examples: Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements by the client. This may be overcome by using the agile and scrum methodologies and effective communication.
Tight deadlines. This may be overcome through prioritization of tasks and regular assesment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing individual components of software.
Integration testing is testing the interaction between different components or system.
System testing is testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing is testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets the users needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt-'Tell me all about history.'
Improved prompt - 'Tell me all about the history of cats in the Victiorian times'

In the above case, the improved prompt is more effective as it gives a clear setting, a specific species and time and it is straight to the point.
